# MoosendFDW

This is still a work in progress, but at some point it will become a
Multicorn-based foreign data wrapper for the Moosend API.

Why? Because I want to control my mailing lists from postgresql; because I want
postgresql to *be* my API; because Graphile makes it possible for me to design a
database model and use it as my API.

A better README will happen once I like this project enough to release it.
